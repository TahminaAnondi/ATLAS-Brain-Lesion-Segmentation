## ATLAS - Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke MICCAI CHALLENG

ATLAS consists of T1w MRIs and manually segmented lesion masks that includes training (n = 655), test (hidden masks, n = 300). The purpose of this project is to implement a deep learning model for better lesion segmentation on brain MRI images. This dataset can be found [here](https://atlas.grand-challenge.org/ATLAS/) on Grand Challenge.

ATLAS is part of the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) Challenge at the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention ([MICCAI](http://www. isles-challenge.org/)) in 2022.


## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing step transforms all the NIfIT images into 2D slices. Originally, the 3D images are of the size of 189 x 197 x 233 pixels. The 2D slices are on the x-y plane and each image is padded to be square. To achieve better quality of images, the first and last 50 slices are not chosen because they are more likely to be broken or are just part of skull.
